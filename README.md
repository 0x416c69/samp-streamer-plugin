SA-MP Streamer Plugin v2.6.2
============================

This plugin streams objects, pickups, checkpoints, race checkpoints, map icons, and 3D text labels at user-defined server ticks. Basic area detection is also included. Because it is written entirely in C++, much of the overhead from PAWN is avoided. This streamer, as a result, is quite a bit faster than any other implementation currently available in PAWN.

Compilation
-----------

Windows: Open the solution file (streamer.sln) in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or higher. Build the project.
